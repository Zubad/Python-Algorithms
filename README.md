Python: Implementation of different Algorithm for Beginners


	"In computer science or programming, sequential steps which are used to perform a task on computer is called an algorithm. In our daily life, step by step process of solving any problem is called an algorithm."


Every Algorithm has following characteristics:

1. Complexity:
	Time Complexity (How much memory does it require)
	Space Complexity (How much time does it require)

2. Classification:
	Serial or Parallel
	Deterministic or Non-deterministic
	Exact or Approximate
	
3. Input and Output:
	What input a algorithm accept and what it provide in output.

	Common Algorithms:
1. Sorting Algorithms:
	It is used on unorder data to sort the data in ascending or descending order.

2. Search Algorithms:
	It is used when we have to find a specific data in a large data structure. for example, finding a sub string within a string.
	
3. Computational Algorithms:
	It is used to calculate another type of data when one set of data is given.

4. Collection Algorithms:
	It is used when we have to work with collection of data (Filtering unwanted data, count specific items, etc)

	There are ways to determine/understand the performance of an Algorithm. The simplest is measure how an algorithm respond to a data set and the	other is Big-O notaion.
	Big-O notaion classifies the performance of an algorithm according to data size (When data given as input increases of decreases). "O" indicates the order of operation, such as time scale to perform an operation. Big-O has terms like O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(n logn) and O(n^2) which represent constant time, logarithmic, linear time, log lonear and quadratic respectively.
